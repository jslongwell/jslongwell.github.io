                    Hello! My name is Justin Longwell and I'm a (soon-to-be) software developer from Cleveland, Ohio. I began educating myself in web development at a young age and have enjoyed learning about new technologies throughout my life. More recently, I've enrolled in a 14-week full stack web development bootcamp focused around C# at We Can Code IT to further my coding knowledge. Once I've graduated from the program as a certified web developer, I hope to transition to working full-time in the field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't have much more to say at this time, so here's some gibberish to fill out this page.Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Quisque ut aliquam urna. Integer non accumsan diam, nec hendrerit libero. Ut ut arcu dignissim, egestas risus vitae, molestie felis. Cras felis leo, eleifend sed eros vel, ultrices finibus leo. Sed iaculis sodales lectus, sed tempor quam dictum eu. Aenean purus sem, cursus sed massa et, blandit luctus ligula. Nullam tempus odio sed mi sodales, non luctus mauris dictum.

                    <h3>Roller Coaster Stats Keeper</h3>
                    <p>This is a simple console application coded to meet the requirements of the assignment &quot;Class of Your Choice&quot;. It actually makes use of three custom classes of &quot;my choice&quot;: RollerCoaster, Park, and Trip. The application allows a user to track the roller coasters that they ride during a trip to an amusement park. It then allows a user to view the statistics about their trip.</p>
